# Jooby Samples
Simple samples based on [Jooby](http://jooby.org) a scalable, fast and modular micro web framework for Java.
 
## Introduction
Since **Jooby** is a pretty new thing in the Java-ecosystem, I decided to contribute to the project by providing a complete (I hope) set of samples on how to use this awesome framework.
The modules included in Jooby are a lot and some of them hide some interesting gems (did you check the Thread Model API? so cool!), so I want to try to show its potential.

## First Step
The first step of the project is to provide random samples keeping an eye on the pattern shown in the official [Jooby-Modules](http://jooby.org/modules) page.
There is no road-map for now, so there is no priority on which module will be completed first, hence be patient.
However if I'm able to get the right rhythm I could try to be less generic. This will be a checklist, so drop by whenever you need to check the progress:

* **Route Spec**
* **Data: Jdbc**
* **Data: NoSQL**
* **Assets: CSS Processors**
* **Assets: Javascript Processors**
* **Renderer**
* **Parser**
* **Reactive & Async**
* **Http Session**
* **Caches**
* **Security**

## Languages and Build Systems
For now just:
* **Oracle Java 8**
* **Apache Maven 3.3.9**

Then (I don't know when, sorry):
* **Gradle 2.x+**
* **Kotlin 1.x+**
* **Javascript**

In a dream of mine:
* **Ceylon 1.3.x+**
